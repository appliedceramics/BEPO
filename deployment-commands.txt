DEPLOYMENT FIX COMMANDS

1. Push updates to GitHub:
git add .
git commit -m "Fix deployment configuration for Fun Calculator"
git push origin main

2. In your deployment platform (Vercel/Netlify/Railway):
- Set environment variables:
  DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_url
  SESSION_SECRET=your_secret_key
  NODE_ENV=production

3. Run in platform terminal:
npm run db:push

4. Redeploy the application

The Fun Calculator code is working - this is purely a deployment configuration issue.
