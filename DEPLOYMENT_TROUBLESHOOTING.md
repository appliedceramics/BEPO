# Fun Calculator Deployment Fix

## Issue
Fun Calculator works locally but fails after deployment to production.

## Root Cause
Deployment platforms often have different configurations for:
- Environment variables
- Database connections
- Static file serving
- API routes

## Solutions

### For Vercel Deployment
1. **Set environment variables** in Vercel dashboard:
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `SESSION_SECRET` 
   - `NODE_ENV=production`

2. **Run database setup** in Vercel terminal:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

### For Netlify/Other Platforms
1. **Set environment variables** in platform dashboard
2. **Ensure database connection** is accessible from deployment platform
3. **Run migration**: `npm run db:push`

### Quick Fix Commands
```bash
# After deployment, run these in your platform's terminal:
npm install
npm run db:push
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Redeploy Steps
1. **Push fixes to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Trigger redeploy** on your hosting platform

3. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly

4. **Test calculator endpoints**:
   - `/api/calculator-settings`
   - `/api/user`
   - `/api/insulin-logs`

The calculator logic is correct - this is purely a deployment configuration issue.
